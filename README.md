# importtime output wrapper

Starting from the Python3.7 release, the ```-X importtime``` option is available.
It can be used to measure the import time for any python module, **including all nested imports**.

The official documentaion for this function can be found here:
https://docs.python.org/3.7/using/cmdline.html#id5

Any pull requests are welcome.üç∞

## Installation

`pip install importtime-output-wrapper`

## Implemented features

The implementaion prints out the output to the ```stderr``` in string format. To actually use this output for benchmarking, I wrote this simple wrapper, that parses the output and puts it into a usable ```json``` format.

Alternatively, the tool can format the output as a waterfall digram. However, this feature only serves to provide a quick overview.

The ```importtime-output-wrapper``` can also sort the imported modules (and their nested imports) by the time they needed.

It has a command-line interface that works as follows:

```console
$ importtime_output_wrapper [-h] [--format [{json,waterfall}]]
                                 [--sort [{self,cumulative}]]
                                 [--time [{self,cumulative}]]
                                 [--width [WIDTH]] [--depth [DEPTH]]
                                 module
```

As ```module``` any python module can be provided.
The optional argument ```--sort``` will sort the output either by the time every module needed to import (```--sort self```) or by the cumulative time (```--sort cumulative```).
### output as json
For example: calling ```$ python -X importtime -c "import os"``` would produce the following (reduced) output:
```console
import time: self [us] | cumulative | imported package
import time:      1504 |       1504 | _frozen_importlib_external
import time:      1073 |       1073 |   time
import time:      1749 |       2821 | zipimport
[...]
```

...and insted if you call ```$ importtime-output-wrapper os```, it will produce the following (reduced) output:
```console
[
  {
    "name": "_frozen_importlib_external",
    "depth": 1,
    "t_self_us": 610,
    "t_cumulative_us": 610,
    "nested_imports": []
  },
  {
    "name": "zipimport",
    "depth": 1,
    "t_self_us": 230,
    "t_cumulative_us": 567,
    "nested_imports": [
      {
        "name": "time",
        "depth": 2,
        "t_self_us": 337,
        "t_cumulative_us": 337,
        "nested_imports": []
      }
    ]
  },
  [...]
]
```
### output as waterfall diagram
As an additional feature, the program can also display the output as a waterfall digram in the terminal. For the above example, calling ```$ importtime-output-wrapper os --format waterfall``` results in the following (reduced) output:
```console
module name                   import time (us)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
_frozen_importlib_external    ========(576)
zipimport                     ====(280)
.time                         ======(413)
encodings                     =====================(1410)
.codecs                       ==========(688)
.._codecs                     =(75)
.encodings.aliases            ===========(762)
encodings.utf_8               =====(328)
[...]
site                          ===========================================(2865)
.os                           ==========(684)
..stat                        =======(509)
..._stat                      (54)
.._collections_abc            =================(1155)
..posixpath                   =====(385)
...genericpath                ====(277)
._sitebuiltins                ====(289)
._bootlocale                  ===(249)
.._locale                     =(70)
[...]
```
The output is scaled to 79 characters by default. The number behind the bar indicates the import time in microseconds. Both the width of the output and the time used in the waterfall diagram can be adjusted, as described below.

## Further settings
### Depth
To adjust the output to the depth of the modules the paramater ```--depth``` can be used.
The following shows an output with different depths in each case:

(Depth = No Limit)
```console
io                            ======(273)
.abc                          =====(237)
.._abc                        (36)
site                          =========================================(1701)
.os                           ==================(739)
..stat                        ======(254)
..._stat                      =(50)
```
(Depth = 2)
```console
io                            ======(273)
.abc                          =====(237)
site                          =========================================(1701)
.os                           ==================(739)
```

### Time used in the waterfall diagram
If the display as a waterfall diagram has been selected, the parameter ```--time``` can be used to set whether the "self" time or the "cumulative" time is to be used to display the diagram.
### Width of the watefall diagram
If the display as a waterfall diagram was selected, the parameter ```--width``` can be used to set how wide the diagram should be displayed. Note that a too small width can lead to no meaningful representation of the measured times. By default a width of 79 characters is used.

I personally used this tool to sort the output of the ```-X importtime``` implementaion to index modules that were slowing down the startup of a larger project.
Maybe someone else will find this functionality useful someday.

**Note** that its output may be broken in multi-threaded application, as mentioned in the [official documentation](https://docs.python.org/3.7/using/cmdline.html#id5 "importtime documentation").
